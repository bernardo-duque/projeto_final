## 2. Pastas

##### `/codigo`
- Any code that manipulates build data and performs analysis should be put here.
- All output should be redirected into `/output`. Ideally as a single data file called, say, `data.dta`.
- Keep code clean and modularized.

  `/sub`
  - Holds modularized code to implement subroutines in `build.do` and `analysis.do`.
  
##### `/input`
- Any original data source should be included here in clean and normalized form.
- Only include cleaned files. Raw external files should be cleaned in each data source specific folder.
- These data sets will then be manipulated and merged by the files in `/code`.
  
##### `/output`
- Holds the final data set, to be then used in `/code/analysis.do`.
- Contains all analysis objects generated by files in `/code`.
- Will then serve as source for the generation of `.tex` files.

#### `/produto_final

##### `run_paper.py`
- Automates the whole paper construction.
- Runs everything in a pre-specified order, from beginning (building data sets) to end (compiling `.tex` files).
- Keeps clear what should be run when.
- Also cleans `/output` and `/tmp` folders before running other code.

##### `/code/get_input.py`
- Erases any file inside `/input` and copies any original data set from outside sources.
- Ensures consistency across original data generation and data building for paper.
